"What?"</h1>
<p >HL-HDF is a high level interface to the Heirachical Data Format, version 5, developed and maintained by the HDF Group (<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org">http://www.hdfgroup.org</a>). HDF5 is a file format designed for a maximum of flexibility and efficiency and it makes use of modern software technology. Briefly, HDF5 has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platform independence. For example, an array of native floating point values written on one platform will be automatically identified, byte-swapped if necessary, and returned as an array of native floating point values on another platform. </li>
<li>Built-in compression using the free ZLIB compression library. ZLIB is well-known as the compression used in the gzip package and it is robust and efficient. </li>
<li>Flexible. HDF5 offers the ability to store virtually any kind of scientific data. </li>
<li>The HDF5 Groups URL is <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>HL-HDF is designed to focus on selected HDF5 functionality and make it available to users at a high level of abstraction, the idea being to make the management of their data easier. A strong effort has been made to ensure that this functionality, although a limited subset of HDF5 functionality, provides a general and flexible set of tools for managing arbitrary data. Like HDF5, HL-HDF is meant to be used on different computer platforms. In practise this means different flavours of UNIX and NT. HDF5 may work on other systems, like the Mac, DOS and VMS, but The HDF Group does not support them (yet) which means that HL-HDF does not support them either. This is not to say that they will not work on these platforms, however.</p>
<p >Binary tools available with HDF5 will work with files written with HL-HDF. For example, <b>h5dump</b> can be used to determine the contents of an HDF5 file written with HL-HDF. A few test programs are included with HL-HDF which can read/write raw data to/from HDF5 files. These test programs may be useful to users who do not wish to write their own routines using the functionality available in HL-HDF, but would prefer to rely on a simpler encoder and decoder. These programs can also be used as examples of how to write routines using HL-HDF.</p>
<p >HL-HDF is free software and it may be used used by anyone according to SMHI's and The HDF Groups copyright statements containined in this document. Users are encouraged to report their feedback to the author, and to contribute to its development.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="the_w5_of_hlhdf_what"></a>
"What?"</h1>
<p >This software is designed to facilitate the management of scientific data from multiple sources. The integration of observations from various observational systems such as weather stations, satellites and radars is an area which is receiving increased attention. An increasing amount of work is also being carried out on integrating such observations with information from numerical models, and in assimilating the observations into the models. Unfortunately, most types of data are stored in different file formats and little effort has been made to facilitate the exchange of data between disciplines such as meteorology, hydrology and oceanography. Since SMHI is the national agency responsible for operational activities in all three of these disciplines, it would obviously be beneficial to these operations if a rationalization of data management procedures can be realized. This is the reason why the HL-HDF software has been developed.</p>
<p >Another important reason why HL-HDF has been developed is that it facilitates the management of multi-source data for pure research and development activities. This is due to the software's flexibility which provides a platform for managing virtually any variable and combination of variables imaginable.</p>
<p >Due to HDF5's platform independent nature, its use can even be considered for exchange between organizations, either domestically or internationally. Its built-in compression is efficient which increases the potential amount of data available in archives and helps make them more useful.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="the_w5_of_hlhdf_where"></a>
"Where?"</h1>
<p >HL-HDF has been developed for use in three general areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>General purpose research and development. </li>
<li>Data management. HL-HDF can be used wherever there are requirements put on managing scientific data, whether it be with a small amount of data by a single person or with a comprehensive archive by a large organization. </li>
<li>Data exchange. HL-HDF can be used almost anywhere data exchange is required. This can be within an organization or between organizations, either domestically or internationally.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="the_w5_of_hlhdf_when"></a>
"When?"</h1>
<p >HL-HDF has been developed during the first half of 2000 on a small budget as a one-off pilot project. This means that there is no ongoing project group and no official support. The objective has been to develop HL-HDF and then release it for anyone to use as he or she pleases. Feedback is naturally welcome to the e-mail address on this document's front page, and we hope to be able to incorporate improvements as best we can.</p>
<p >The timing of HL-HDF has been fortunate. Had we gotten underway earlier, we probably would have chosen HDF4. Had we waited until later, then several of our applications may have chosen inferiour file formats. It feels as though this work has been done in the right place at the right time.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="the_w5_of_hlhdf_who"></a>
"Who?"</h1>
<p >Who can use HL-HDF? Anyone who works with scientific data can use HL-HDF, whether it be research and development with a limited amount of data or management of vast volumes of data in operational environments.</p>
<p >Who has worked on this project? The programming has been performed by Anders Henja. Daniel Michelson has coordinated the project. Mike Folk and Quincey Koziol of the HDF group at the NCSA have also been very helpful. An "ad hoc reference group" has followed the project's progress. This group consists of the following people:</p>
