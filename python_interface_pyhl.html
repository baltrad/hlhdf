<div class="textblock"><p >PyHL is just like the HL-HDF library in that it allows the user to work with HDF5 at a high level.</p>
<p >PyHL is designed to work at the highest level of abstraction using the Python programming language, since Python allows the user to interact directly with HDF5 files. In fact, PyHL is nothing more than a wrapper around HL-HDF but with some additional functionality which is only available in very high level languages such as Python. Like HL-HDF, it is up to the user to define appropriate ways of representing data and using the building blocks available in PyHL to store the data in HDF5.</p>
<p >(PyHL is pronounced "pile", which is an appropriate description of a heirarchy ...)</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="pyhl_compilation_and_installation"></a>
Compilation and installation</h1>
<p >The Python programming language, version 2.5.2, is required along with the Numpy package. Python is found at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives at <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a> and Numpy is found at <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">http://numpy.scipy.org/</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="pyhl_create_module"></a>
Create module _pyhl</h2>
<p >If the configure script was not called with <b>&ndash;with-python=no</b> the _pyhl module should be compiled together with the rest of the code. If the configure script was called with <b>&ndash;with-python=no</b>, then the best thing is to rebuild the whole HL-HDF package (with <b>&ndash;with-python=yes</b>) and installation as descriped in Sections <a class="el" href="CompilationAndInstallation.html">Compilation and Installation</a>.</p>
<p ><b>NOTE:</b> Python version 2.5.2 is required to compile _pyhl; otherwise there will be unresolved symbols. Also, be aware that the hdf5 library is linked dynamically which requires that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains the path to where libhdf5.so has been installed. contains the path to where libhdf5.so has been installed.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="pyhl_examples"></a>
Examples</h2>
<p >The creation of HDF5 files with PyHL is quite easy, and there are not to many things one has to know about the HDF5 internals. However, in order to build an HDF5 file, one has to understand that the file should be built sequentialy, i.e. it is not possible to create a subgroup to a group before the group has been created. Neither is it possible to create an attribute or a dataset in a group before the group has been created etc. In other words, always create the top nodes before trying to create nodes under them in the heirarchy.</p>
<p >Another thing to bear in mind is that when the method <b>addNode</b> has been called the <b>nodelist</b> instance will take control over the node, so it will not be possible to alter the node after a call to <b>addNode</b> has been made.</p>
<p >When working with compound types, remember that the data that is passed to <b>setScalarValue</b> and <b>setArrayValue</b> must be a Python string. Also when working with compound types, the <b>itemSize</b> and <b>lhid</b> has to be passed on, otherwise the compound data most likely will be corrupted.</p>
<p >Another thing to be aware of when working with compound types is that the hdf5 library has to be linked dynamically, otherwise it will not be possible to pass the <b>hid_t</b> references between the Python modules.</p>
<p >Time to look at some simple examples. These examples can be found in <b>HLHDF/examples</b>. In order to get these examples to run you will need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point at the HDF5 so library and the PYTHONPATH needs to be pointing at both the test catalogue where the rave_info_type is defined and the pyhl catalogue.</p>
<pre class="fragment">prompt$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;path to hdf5 library&gt;
prompt$ export PYTHONPATH=&lt;path to HLHDF/pyhl&gt;:&lt;path to HLHDF/test/python&gt;
</pre><p >Then it is just to run the different examples by typing: </p><pre class="fragment">prompt% python &lt;TestFileName.py&gt;

Writing an HDF5 file containing a compound datatype</h2>
<p >This is a bit more complex since it requires the implementation of a Python C++-module that contains the datatype definition, and a couple of methods for converting data to a string and the other way around.</p>
<p >There is a small example located in the <b>test/python</b> directory called <b><a class="el" href="rave__info__type_8c.html">rave_info_type.c</a></b> which implements a small compound type definition. Basically this module defines an object containing <b>xscale</b>, <b>yscale</b>, <b>xsize</b> and <b>ysize</b> variables. This module has also got a type class which should be used.</p>
